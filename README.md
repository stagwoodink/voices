## Voices - Enhanced Voice Channel Management
# Voices - Temporary Voice Channel Bot

Enhance your Discord server with **Voices**. Create temporary voice channels on demand, providing a clean and enjoyable user experience. No setup, no configuration – it simply works.

## Features:

- **On-Demand Voice Channels:** Creates temporary voice channels for users as they need them.
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Deletes temporary channels when they are empty.
- **Effortless Setup:** Just invite the bot, and it automatically handles everything.
- **User-Friendly:** Moves users to their new channels seamlessly.
- **Custom Channel Names:** Channels are named based on the user’s nickname.
- **User Control:** Once a channel is created in a user's name that user has the ability to fully manage that channel however they like.

## Why Choose Voices?

- **Privacy:** This bot never stores any member information on our servers. It only retains the server ID and channel ID for reference after restarting. (Feel free to check the source code yourself.)
- **Keeps Your Server Neat:** Maintains an organized server by creating channels only when needed, making it easy for members to navigate.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Adds a feature to your server that enhances user experience, making it clean and enjoyable.
  (Something that I believe should have already been built into Discord by now.

## How It Works:

1. **Trigger Channel Creation:** When the bot joins your server, it automatically creates a trigger voice channel named `voices`.
2. **User Joins Trigger Channel:** When a user joins the trigger channel, the bot creates a temporary voice channel named after the user’s nickname and moves them into it.
4. **Channel Cleanup:** When the temporary channel is empty, the bot deletes it to keep your server tidy.

**Make your server more enjoyable with Voices. [Invite Voices](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1263237947461996605&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot) today and enjoy a seamless voice channel experience.**
